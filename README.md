Other tools Also include Redux or Context API for state management, REST for API integration and Jest for testing.

 
 UI/UX Design Planning:
Design Goals:
This project's main goal is to create an intuitive, easy-to-use platform that closely mimics the functionality and aesthetic of the Airbnb app. The design will focus on clear navigation, responsiveness, and provide a seamless user experience for both guests and property owners.

KEY FEATURES:

User-friendly interface for both desktop and mobile devices.
Simple and effective navigation between pages.
Clean layout with clear calls to action (CTA) for booking, viewing details, and adding to cart.
Dynamic and visually appealing property cards.
A checkout system that is straightforward and easy to complete.
Consistent styling and color schemes to enhance usability and brand identity.

PRIMARY PAGES:
Page	Description	Key Elements
Property Listing View:	This is the main interface of the AirBnB clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal.

Listing Detailed View: This page illustrates a detailed view of a specific property listing within the AirBnB clone. It highlights key features such as the property’s name, location, price, and additional details like amenities. The interface emphasizes clarity and ease of use for potential renters.

Simple Checkout View: This page showcases the booking or reservation process for the selected property in the AirBnB clone. It may include options for selecting dates, the number of guests, and finalizing the booking. The design is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience.

Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System:
A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system as it directly impacts user trust, engagement, and conversion rates. Using Complex or confusing interfaces can deter potential users from completing bookings, thus by focusing on clarity, accessibility, and efficiency, the system will ensure users can confidently and easily navigate the platform, fostering satisfaction and repeat usage.
